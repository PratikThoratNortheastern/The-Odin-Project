# Knowledge check for problem solving section

## What are the three stages in the problem solving process?

> The three stages are Plan, Pseudocode, Divide and Conquer

## Why is it important to understand the problem first?

> It is important to understand what we are trying to solve for. It helps us take actionable steps towards solving problems

## What can you do to get a clearer understanding of the problem?

> This is a subjective question but I plan and break down the problems into smaller chuncks which help me understand the problem better.

## What are some of the things that you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?

> Does your program have a user interface? What will it look like? What functionality will the interface have? Sketch this out on paper.
>
> What inputs will your program have? Will the user enter data or will you get input from somewhere else?
>
> Whatâ€™s the desired output?
>
> Given your inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output?

## What is an algorithm?

> An algorithm is a set of instructions we provide to the computer for it to execute. Think of it as a recipe to acheive a certain goal.

## What is pseudocode?

> Pseudo code is the set of instructions which we write in plain and simple english. This pseudocode is then translated into code.

## What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?

> This process will help us understand the problem better. The problem becomes less overwhelming. We can reach towards the solutions quicker with lesser possibilities of bugs and roadblocks.
