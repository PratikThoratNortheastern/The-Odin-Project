# Functions Knowledge Check

## What are functions useful for?

> To write usable blocks of code and to avoid repetition

## How do you invoke a function?

> This is how you invoke a function
> function myFunction() {
> alert("hello");
> }
> myFunction();
> // calls the function once

## What are anonymous functions?

> Anonymous functions are functions that do not have a name. We also call these functions as function expressions.

## What is function scope?

> Any variable that is declared inside the function can only be used within the function and not outside the function. This is called as function scope. The variables declared using var are function scoped variables.

## What are return values?

> Return values are calculations or values that a function gives back (or as the name suggests, returns). We can then use these return values for almost anything we wish to do.

## What are arrow functions?

> Arrow functions are functions that can be written concisely. They are a short (and cool) way of writing function expressions. Syntax: `() => {}`

## What is the difference between function declaration and function expressions?

> Function Declarations are used to declare or initiate a function with names. Function expressions are used when the execution reaches them. Declarations can be called beforehand but expressions cannot be. They also have a different syntax
