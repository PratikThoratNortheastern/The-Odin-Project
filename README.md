# The-Odin-Project-Course
A repository where I work my way through the Foundations and Fullstack JavaScript track. This repo will record all of my assignments, quiz and projects.

## Intent 🤔🤔🤔
I will use this repository for the sake of consistency and touch base with some fundamental concepts of fullstack web development. 

## Syllabus 📚📚📚
I will work my way through the Odin Project syllabus in the following order:
1. [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)
2. [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)

> Please note that in the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) section I will skip HTML and CSS since I am very well aware of their fundamentals and avoid wasting my time on repeatitive task.

## Includes ⁉⁉⁉
1. Answers to all the knowledge checks.
2. Practice examples and code.
3. Projects and my take on how I approached them.

## A note to myself on Project Implementaion: ⚒⚒⚒
1. Projects will have the implementation specified by The Odin Project
2. Projects will have decent UI/UX, performance, cross-browser compatibility, testing, and mobile-responsiveness
   > Please note: The above point is most likely be plausible to the intermediate and advanced javascript sections.
   > Specifically when I will touch base with frameworks like ReactJs and NodeJs.
3. AI such as ChatGPT, claude and V0 will not be used.
4. Every Project within itself will be well documented and have screenshots or video recordings of itself.

## Mentality 🧠🧠🧠
Just Do it. Have the grit and understand shit inside out.

That is all
